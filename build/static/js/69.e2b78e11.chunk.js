Re-evaluations are supplemented with visual assessments by the Client, which should be conducted at least once a year, when the Client or its management agent (if th housing is rented in the future) receives complaints from residents about deteriorated paint or other potential lead hazards, when the residence (or if, in the future, the house will have more than one dwelling unit, any unit that turns over or becomes vacant), or when significant damage occurs that could affect the integrity of hazard control treatments (e.g., flooding, vandalism, fire). The visual assessment should cover the dwelling unit (if, in the future, the housing will have more than one dwelling unit, each unit and each common area used by residents), exterior painted surfaces, and ground cover (if control of soil-lead hazards is required or recommended).

At these dwellings, the very real potential exists for LBP hazards to develop. Hazards can develop by means such as, but not limited to: the failure of lead hazard control measures; previously intact LBP becoming deteriorated; dangerous levels of lead-in-dust (dust lead) re-accumulating through friction, impact, and deterioration of paint; or, through the introduction of contaminated exterior dust and soil into the interior of the structure. Ongoing monitoring typically includes two different activities: re-evaluation and annual visual assessments. A re-evaluation is a risk assessment that includes limited soil and dust sampling and a visual evaluation of paint films and any existing lead hazard controls. Re-evaluations are supplemented with visual assessments by the Client, which should be conducted at least once a year, when the Client or its management agent (if th housing is rented in the future) receives complaints from residents about deteriorated paint or other potential lead hazards, when the residence (or if, in the future, the house will have more than one dwelling unit, any unit that turns over or becomes vacant), or when significant damage occurs that could affect the integrity of hazard control treatments (e.g., flooding, vandalism, fire). The visual assessment should cover the dwelling unit (if, in the future, the housing will have more than one dwelling unit, each unit and each common area used by residents), exterior painted surfaces, and ground cover (if control of soil-lead hazards is required or recommended). Visual assessments should confirm that all Paint with known or suspected LBP is not deteriorating, that lead hazard control methods have not failed, and that structural problems do not threaten the integrity of any remaining known, presumed or suspected LBP.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class="left">The visual assessments do not replace the need for professional re-evaluations by a certified risk assessor.
